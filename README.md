# Feature Detection with OpenCV - Part 1

## Introduction - Part 1
This repository contains a Python implementation of feature detection using OpenCV's ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithm. The code demonstrates how to detect and visualize important keypoints in images that can be used for various computer vision applications.

## What are Features?
In computer vision, features are interesting points in an image that have specific characteristics like corners or distinctive patterns. The ORB algorithm identifies these points through two main steps:
1. **Detect** points of interest in the image
2. **Describe** these features with numerical representations

ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) is a computationally efficient feature detection algorithm that:
- Detects features using the FAST method
- Creates feature descriptors using a modified BRIEF approach
- Is rotation-invariant and scale-invariant
- Is a patent-free alternative to algorithms like SIFT and SURF

## Code Flow
The implementation follows these steps:
1. Read an image using `cv2.imread()`
2. Resize the image using `cv2.resize()` for better processing
3. Convert the image to grayscale using `cv2.cvtColor()`
4. Initialize the ORB feature detector with `cv2.ORB_create()`
5. Detect keypoints and compute descriptors with `orb.detectAndCompute()`
6. Draw the detected keypoints on the image with `cv2.drawKeypoints()`
7. Display the results with `cv2.imshow()` and wait for user input with `cv2.waitKey()`
